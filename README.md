## Setup Local Development

This project was created with Algokit which in turn uses Python Poetry.

To set it up, run:

```bash
algokit bootstrap all
```

Then, start up your localnet:

```bash
algokit localnet start
```

And finally run tests:

```bash
algokit project run test
```

Checkout the `.algokit.toml` file to understand what other project commands are available.
